flexDrive
==========

The flexDrive is a compact hyperdrive for up to 16 independently movable electrodes. It uses a novel spring mechanism to adjust electrode depth.

This repository only contains design files. See http://open-ephys.github.com/flexDrive for documentation and assembly instructions.

File types
------------
- .brd = EAGLE board files; describe the physical layout of the printed circuit board
- .md = Markdown files; most likely a README file; can be viewed with any text edtior
- .txt  = standard text files
- "gerber" files (.top, .bsk, .oln, etc.) = contain machine-readable instructions for creating the printed circuit board; these are sent to a fab house (such as Sunstone Circuits) for PCB production
- .SLDPRT files = SolidWorks part files; contain CAD models of 3D components
- .SLDDRW files = SolidWorks drawing files; contain 2D images of components
- .DXF = another type of 2D drawing file that can be opened in Adobe Illustrator or similar software
- .STL files = stereolithography files; can be sent to a rapid prototyping service (such as Shapeways) to create 3D objects
- .pdf files = standard document format for viewing and editing 2D images
