        <h3>Electrode array design        </h3>
        <p>         In the flexDrive, electrodes are positioned by an
           array of polyimide tubes:<br>

           <br>
By placing individual guide tube arrays at different locations
           within the drive body, multiple brain regions can be targeted precisely. This control gives
           researchers the ability to adapt the design to fit their specific experimental needs, such as
           recording from elongated but narrow target regions (or from bilateral targets) with a single
         implant.</p>
        <p>  By using only a subset of the guide tubes to hold electrodes, or by introducing
           placeholders and optical fibers into the array, any spatial pattern of electrode and optical
         fiber positions can be fabricated with high repeatability and precision. </p>
        <p> The closest lateral spacing between electrodes that can be accomplished with this method is dictated by the outer diameter of the guide tubes. We recommend a distance of ~250 μm or
           larger for the guide tubes (using 33 gauge), but higher densities of ~125 μm are possible by
           using smaller diameter guide tubes. However, tests conducted with dense electrode arrays
           of pitches of 125 μm failed to yield usable recordings, possibly due to an increased
         inflammatory response.</p>
