      <strong>Attaching EIB to body</strong><br>

<div class="methodblock">Attach EIB to the drive body with screws and/or epoxy, at the same time, insert fiber/s through the holes in EIB. </div>

<div class="methodblock">If connections of electrodes to the opposing side of the EIB are desired, only glue and/or screw the EIB to the drive body on the higher side (see later step)</div>

<strong><br>
Gluing fibers to EIB</strong><br>

<div class="methodblock">
 Position fibers at desired depth, and glue them to the EIB with epoxy. <br>
 Make sure to add epoxy to the top and bottom of the EIB to securely stabilize the ferrule.</div>
 
<strong><br>
Loading electrodes</strong><br>
The following is a adapted standard protocol for electrode loading. 
<br>
See <a href="http://www.jove.com/video/1098/micro-drive-array-for-chronic-in-vivo-recording-tetrode-assembly" target="_new">Nguyen et al. 2009</a> for an in-depth video protocol for electrode loading.<br>
<br>
<div class="methodblock">Load electrodes into the shuttle tubes using ceramic tipped forceps. </div>


<div class="methodblock">Cut each electrode to the desired length with very sharp scissors, if required, make small adjustments to electrode depth, and glue it to the top of shuttle tubes with epoxy. After epoxy is cured, connect electrode to EIB using gold pins and/or solder.  </div>

<div class="methodblock">
  Make sure that there is enough slack in the electrode wire to allow for the full range of drive motion. The top of the drive body is asymmetric, so that the EIB stands off by ~.6mm from one side of the body when only the higher side is glued and/or screwed to the body. This way, electrodes can be laoded and brought around to the other side of the EIB so that the electrodes run under the EIB and are protected. We have also gotten good results from loading the electrodes to the closest vias in the EIB, but this requires a slightly higher level of care to avoid damaging the wires when lowering drives.</div>



<div class="methodblock"> Attach ground and shield wires to the EIB with gold pins and/or solder. The ground wire should extend to the bottom of the drive with enough free length to reach the desired ground site during the implant surgery. </div>
  
  
  <strong><br>
  Attaching the housing/shield</strong><br>
  <img src="imgs/cap_cone.png" width="430" height="279">
<div class="methodblock"> Print templates on standard overhead transparency sheet. </div>
<div class="methodblock"> Glue aluminium foil to transparency sheet with epoxy for the cone part, but use plain transparency sheet for the cap part.</div>
<div class="methodblock"> Cut out parts using scissors, and glue with epoxy, clamp the parts with a hemostat while the epoxy cures.</div>
<div class="methodblock"> For cap: attach optical ferrule cap  (different depending on EIB type) to cap. <br>
Alternatively, use small pieces of adhesive tape to attach cap to drive after implant. We are getting the best results with kapton tape.</div>

<div class="methodblock"> Push the ground wire through the bottom opening of the protective cone and attach cone with epoxy. Make sure there is a strong bridge of epoxy between the side of the drive body and the cone. Use multiple layers of epoxy if needed. Take extra care not to touch and bend electrodes with the protruding end of the ground wire. </div>
 
<div class="methodblock"> Use conductive epoxy to connect the shield wire to the drive shield. Secure with additional layer of epoxy. </div>
 
 <div class="methodblock"> Apply small amount of mineral or silicone oil to the springs where they meet the screws. </div>

<em>The drive is now ready to implant.</em><br>
