Omnetics 18-channel "nano-strip" connectors, 4 guide posts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 32ch_eib_omnetics_2fibers and 32ch_eib_omnetics_1fiber Electrode Interface Boards (EIB) aredesigned to form a connection between 32microwire electrodes or individual wires forming stereotrodes or tetrodes, and two 16 channel omnetics connectors.

See the documentation on http://github.com/open-ephys/flexDrive for building and use instructions.

Connectors on EIB:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* male surface-mount vertical (A79042-001 / NPD-18-VV-GS)

Connectors on Headstage:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
* female surface mount horizontal (A79041-001 / NSD-18-AA-GS)
* female surface mount vertical (A79043-001 / NSD-18-VV-GS)


Pin mapping:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The pin mapping for the GROUND and REFERENCE channels on this EIB are compatible with the mapping on the standard omnetics 16 channel headstages.

Hole sizes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The hole size on this EIB (0.5mm) is suited for use with LARGE neuralynx gold pins (http://neuralynx.com/products/electrode_interface_boards/eib_pins) 

The mounting holes for optical fiber ferrules are sized for use with 1.25mm OD ferrules.


Fabrication instructions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This EIB can be fabricated with the following process
- 8mil trace with / 8mil trace space
- 0.03 inch board thickness (not critical, can be made thicker)
- top silkscreen
