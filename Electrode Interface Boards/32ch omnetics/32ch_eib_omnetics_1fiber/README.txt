About:
The 32ch_eib_omnetics_2fibers and 32ch_eib_omnetics_1fiber Electrode Interface Boards (EIB) aredesigned to form a connection between 32microwire electrodes or individual wires forming stereotrodes or tetrodes, and two 16 channel omnetics connectors.

The pin mapping for the GROUND and REFERENCE channels on this EIB are compatible with the mapping on the standard omnetics 16 channel headstages.

The hole size on this EIB (0.5mm) is suited for use with LARGE neuralynx gold pins (http://neuralynx.com/products/electrode_interface_boards/eib_pins) 

The mounting holes for optical fiber ferrules are sized for use with 1.25mm OD ferrules.

See the documentation on http://github.com/open-ephys/flexDrive for building and use instructions.


Fabrication instructions:

This EIB can be fabricated with the following process
- 8mil trace with / 8mil trace space
- 0.03 inch board thickness (not critical, can be made thicker)
- top silkscreen
